# Knowledge Base Skeleton

![](screenshot.jpg)

This is the skeleton package of the [Knowledge Base theme](https://github.com/Perlkonig/grav-theme-knowledge-base).

## Installation

Ideally, you should download this skeleton as part of a pre-assembled package from [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons), which will give you everything you need to get started.

If you already have Grav installed and functioning, then you will essentially be replacing the default `user` folder with the skeleton. To do this, download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/`. Then, rename the folder to `user`. 

If a user folder already exists, back up the folder to a safe place, delete it (if there is no custom content in it you wish to keep) or replace its contents with the files in the unzipped folder.

You should now have all the skeleton files under

	/your/site/grav/user/
